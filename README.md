# Dark Sublime Syntax Theme for Atom

An unholy mashup of rubjo's Ultimate Dark Neo and odahcam's Atom Sublime Monokai Syntax with a little bit of markdown support thrown in for good measure.

It's a dark theme, but with less contrast so it's slightly easier on the eyes.

Best used with [Victor Mono](https://rubjo.github.io/victor-mono/).
